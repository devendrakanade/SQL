Q. SQL query to get the first name and last name of the customer whose age is the second highest in the Table.

Ans:

SELECT first_name, last_name 
FROM customer
WHERE age = (
    SELECT MAX(age)
    FROM customer
    WHERE age < (SELECT MAX(age) FROM customer)
);



Explanation:
1. Inner Query 1 (SELECT MAX(age) FROM customer): Retrieves the highest age.  
2. Inner Query 2 (SELECT MAX(age) FROM customer WHERE age < (subquery)): Finds the second-highest age by filtering out the highest age.  
3. Outer Query: Select the first_name and last_name of customers whose age matches the second-highest age.  


Example:
Table: customer

| first_name | last_name | age |
|------------|-----------|-----|
| John       | Doe       | 35  |
| Alice      | Smith     | 28  |
| Bob        | Johnson   | 30  |


Result:

| first_name | last_name |
|------------|-----------|
| Bob        | Johnson   |
