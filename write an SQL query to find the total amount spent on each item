Question:
Given the following table of orders, write an SQL query to find the total amount spent on each item. The result should be ordered by "order_id" in descending order.

Orders Table:

| order_id | item      | amount | customer_id |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1        | Keyboard  | 400    | 4           |
| 2        | Mouse     | 300    | 4           |
| 3        | Monitor   | 12000  | 3           |
| 4        | Keyboard  | 400    | 1           |
| 5        | Mousepad  | 250    | 2           |


Expected Output:

| item      | total_amount |
|-----------|--------------|
| Keyboard  | 13350        |
| Mouse     | 600          |
| Mousepad  | 250          |
| Monitor   | 12000        |


Ans:

SELECT item, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY item
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;

Explanation:

GROUP BY item: This groups the results by each unique item in the orders table, so the SUM(amount) will calculate the total amount for each distinct item.
ORDER BY total_amount DESC: This orders the result set based on the total amount spent on each item in descending order. This way, the item with the highest total amount will appear first.
