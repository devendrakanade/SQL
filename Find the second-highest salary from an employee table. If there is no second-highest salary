SQL query to find the second-highest salary from an employee table. If there is no second-highest salary it will return NULL:  

Ans:

SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee);


Explanation:
1. The subquery (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee) gets the highest salary.
2. The WHERE salary < (subquery) filters out the highest salary.
3. The outer query calculates the maximum salary from the remaining salaries, which is the second-highest.

Handle Case When No Second-Highest Salary:
If all employees have the same salary or there is only one employee, the query will return `NULL`.


Alternative Query Using DISTINCT:
If there are duplicate salaries:

SELECT DISTINCT salary AS second_highest_salary
FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;


Explanation:
1. DISTINCT ensures unique salaries.
2. ORDER BY salary DESC sorts salaries in descending order.
3. LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1 skips the highest salary and fetches the second-highest.
